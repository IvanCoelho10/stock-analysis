Green Stock Analysis

* Overview of project

Steve was able to analyze data to have a better understanding of Green Energy stocks to help his parents. I worked on VBA (Visual Basic Aplications) to get 
better solution for year 2017 and 2018.
First it all, I analized those stocks to have a better understanding for what suggest for Seteve's parents.

 * Purpose
 
Analysing Green Energy Stock I see what the best investment for Steve's parents. In this case this project was to efficient in different ways.
The purpose of this analysis was to see which Green Energy stocks were going to be the best investment for Steveâ€™s parents. 


* Results Analysis

When I change and refactoring my original script was consistent and I could run the code efficient.
The year of 2017 we have 11 stocks with postive performance.

The perfomance was very different in 2017 and 2018, but the year 2017 were more positive than 2018. 
In 2018 Steve's parents could see 10 stocks drop in percent of annual return.

* Refactoring 

When the refactoring was done the code was more efficient, the code was clearer and cleaner, 
it reduced time, and the analysis was clearer for Steve's parents.

 * Refactoring VBA(Original)

The most challenging and where I understood that it was a disadvantage for me, 
was redoing the code and trying to find where it would be best to change the code
